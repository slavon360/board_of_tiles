# Description
The code represent a board of tiles. Every 2 tiles have the same image. At the beginning of a game each tile is closed,
 so user can not see a image. 
 The gameplay is the sequence of rounds. In each round user should select 2 tiles with
the same image to make them disappear. If he selects 2 tiles with different colors then they are flipped to "closed" state, 
and user proceeds with the next round. The game is considered to be over when all of the tiles are opened.
